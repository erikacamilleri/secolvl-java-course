# Christmas Coding Challenge



## Santa Parcel Delivery

Santa needs a program to check the size and weight of parcels to determine which can be accepted to deliver on Christmas Eve. 

There are three tasks to complete, one is easy, the other is a little harder, and the last one is most difficult! Only experienced programmers can help with the last one!

But we are in luck, we can do this challenge to help Santa together.

### Task 1 - Check the size and weight of each parcel (EASY)

Input and store the weight and dimensions for one parcel. All the dimensions (l, b, h) and the weight must be validated on entry and an unsuitable parcel is rejected.

- Dimension (l or b or h) cannot be more than 100cm
- The sum of all dimensions (l + b + h) must not be greater than 300cm.
- The weight must be between 1kg and 10kg (inclusive).

### Task 2 - Check the size and weight of many parcels (MEDIUM)

Input and store the number of parcels. Calculate the number of parcels accepted and the total weight of the parcels. For each parcel rejected, output all the reasons why.

- Output the number of parcels accepted.
- Output the number of parcels rejected.

### Task 3 - Calculate how many candy canes Santa needs to fuel the journey (HARD)

Calculate the number of candy canes required to deliver each parcel. Use the following rules...

- 1kg to 5kg (inclusive) need 10 candy canes
- Each 100g over 5kg up to 10kg costs one extra candy cane.

## There is a catch...

One task builds on the other... so we have to work together if we want to help Santa. Are you up for the challenge?
