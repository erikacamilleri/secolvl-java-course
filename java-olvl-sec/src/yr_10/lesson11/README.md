In this practical lesson we will create another menu-driven program. However this time, it will allow the user to record last week's temperatures and get basic information such as the average temperature.

Here is some sample output:

## Remember these skills from last week

1. Displaying a menu of functional options.
2. Accepting the choice of the user.
3. Passing the choice through a `switch...case`
4. Create and call methods for the options.

## Skills to try this lesson

1. Adding in a `do...while` loop so that the user can call a function after inserting the information.
2. More practice with arrays and for loops.
3. Creating and calling methods that accept array parameters.
4. Creating and calling methods that return an array value.
5. Using `Array.length` in the methods to get to know how many elements are in the array.
