# Array Helpers

Aside from the `length` property, an array does not come with any useful built-in functionality.

Below is a screenshot of the "hints" I get when I used Visual Studio Code.

This is slightly strange because arrays are so useful, and there are so many things we would want to go with a group of elements:

- Find the largest value.
- Find the smallest value.
- Find the sum of all values (if the array is numerical).
- Shuffle elements to get a jumbled up array.
- Look for a particular value.

All of the above routines are very useful, and most likely you will need to use at least one of the above in your coursework. But, we don't have to code all of the above on our own, we can do it as a class!

The `ArrayHelpers.java` already contains some helpful routines which have been coded by older students. It is your turn now to do your bit.

## Are you up for the challenge?

Above, we have listed common helper methods to do with arrays. Methods to filter elements in an array, for example, return all the integers greater than 5 are extremely useful too but slightly more challenging.
If you are up for the challenge, here are a few ideas. When you manage, let your teacher know so that your contribution could be added to the repository with *your name* on it!

- Greater Than (Number Arrays)
- Less Than (Number Arrays)
- Starting With (String Arrays)
- Ending With (String Arrays)
- Contains (String Arrays)
