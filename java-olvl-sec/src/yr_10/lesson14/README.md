# Problem Solving Practice

In theory lessons we have looked into the System Development Life Cycle and we have seen that building a solution has many steps. Solving complex problems is difficult to do on your own, but as a class we can make it! We just need to be patient and go through some steps. Most of the time, solving a problem requires *thinking*, then coding it is easy!

## 1. Gathering requirements from Bake a Cake Inc.

Our client is the owner of “Bake a Cake” shop and has recently invested in an automated
cupcake vending machine. This vending machine is programmed to
prepare various cupcakes:
1. Vanilla
2. Chocolate
3. Blueberry
4. Lemon

We need to design an algorithm so that the vending machine can:

- allow the user, who is a customer, to purchase UP TO THREE cupcakes at one go;
- allow the user, who is a customer, to choose the type of cupcake/s to purchase;
- if three cupcakes are purchased at one go, the cupcake machine
issues the price for two; and
- print receipt.

## 2. Analysis of whether a vending machine makes sense

After we spoke to the client, we need to understand the problem and in this case, really think about whether having a vending machine for cupcakes can work as the client suggests.
As a class we have considered a few made up scenarios, and tried to list some steps of what the customer will do to get some cupcakes.

</div>

## 3. Design the algorithm for the vending machine

We will now refer to Chapter 51 for this exercise. As a class, we had tried to think of a flowchart that can describe how things will work logically.

## 4. Code the algorithm in a programming language

## 5. Test the algorithm for various test data
