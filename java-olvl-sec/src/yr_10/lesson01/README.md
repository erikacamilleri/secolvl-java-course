The best way to learn Java is to practice! Best practice by solving problems. They don't have to be too difficult. In just five minutes you can do all of the above.

## How can I run this program?
<br/>

In App.java in the `main()` type the following:

```
QuickRefresher.lesson()
```

Pro Tip: Might be better to type it rather than copy and paste, because typing it out will help VSCode add the necessary `import yr_10.lesson01.QuickRefresher;` automatically at the very very top!
