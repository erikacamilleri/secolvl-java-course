# Food Express

Let's create a program that models the real world process of placing a food order. This code was created using the design thinking process. For more information on how to build solutions in this way, you can read more [here](https://erikacamilleri.wixsite.com/bytesizelearning/post/chapter-50-problem-solving).

# User Stories

 A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer.

## Feature Place an Order

As a customer, when I load the app, I would like to see a menu of food items, so that it is clear what I can order.

| Acceptance Criteria      |
| ------------------------ |
| Display numbered list    | 

As a customer, when I pick a food item, I would like to see the running total of my cart, so that I am careful not to go over budget.

| Acceptance Criteria                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Accept a unique code for food item                   |
| Display cart total (number of items) e.g. $15.00 (1) | 

As a customer, when I finish my order, I would like to see a breakdown of my order, so that I can display it to the server when I collect my order.

| Acceptance Criteria                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------|
| Break down of order with total at the end                    |
| Unique Code for order                                        |   

# Technical Documentation

Due to Covid-19 mitigation measures you are not expected to create objects in Java. However, Java is an object-oriented language therefore unfortunately a lot of power is lost. Object-oriented is not the only software paradigm. The alternative, functional style can work just as well. Below is a list of popular programming techniques that are in a functional style.

# Parallel Arrays

A good alternative to store *records* like of a person, or of a menu. These are multiple arrays of the same size such that i-th element of each array is closely related! All i-th elements together represent an object or entity. In FoodExpress three arrays represent a single food item record consisting of the food code, name of the item and the price.
