## Bake a Cake Inc.

The owner of “Bake a Cake” shop has recently invested in an automated
cupcake vending machine. This vending machine is programmed to
prepare various cupcakes:
1. Vanilla
2. Chocolate
3. Blueberry
4. Lemon

Design an algorithm so that the vending machine can:

- allow the user to purchase UP TO THREE cupcakes at one go;
- allow the user to choose the type of cupcake/s to purchase;
- if three cupcakes are purchased at one go, the cupcake machine
issues the price for two; and
- print receipt.
