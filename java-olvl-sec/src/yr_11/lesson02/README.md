# Array Helpers

We have already seen that arrays are useful data structures. We normally need to put data of the same type in an array to be able to process them in some way. For example, we might need to search for an element, order the elements in a particular way, or order them in no order at all! These are common problems in the sense that no matter what goal you are trying to reach it is very likely that you would need to perform some algorithm on an array. For this reason, we are creating an `ArrayHelpers` class that will contain implementations of useful array algorithms.

## Common Array Helpers

Here is a list of common functions or algorithms (video explainers available) that we can perform on arrays:

- (Linear/Sequential Search)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GPdGsB3OSc]
- (Selection Sort)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-PGLbMth_g]
- (Fisher Yates Shuffle)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zx5bM2OcvA]
- Get First/Last Element
- Summation of Elements (Number Arrays Only)
- Minimum (Number Arrays Only)
- Maximum (Number Arrays Only)
- Is Empty

## Advanced Array Helpers

Might be useful to be able to filter elements in an array, for example, return all the integers greater than 5. We will try and work on some advanced filtering functions in class.

- Greater Than (Number Arrays)
- Less Than (Number Arrays)
- Starting With (String Arrays)
- Ending With (String Arrays)
- Contains (String Arrays)
