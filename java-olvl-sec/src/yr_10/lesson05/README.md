## While Loop

Sometimes, repetition which is not fixed is required. In such cases a for loop is not very useful. However, the `while` loop offers non-fixed iteration.

```
while(/* test goes here */) {
    // instruction (s) to be repeated go here, may not be run!
}
```

## Do While Loop

This is very similar to a while loop, just the test condition is at the end not at the beginning.

```
do {
    // instruction (s) to be repeated go here, run at least once
} while (/* test condition goes here */)
```
