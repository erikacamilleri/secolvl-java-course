# Food Express

Let's create a program that models the real world process of placing a food order. This code was created using the design thinking process. For more information on how to build solutions in this way, you can read more [here](https://erikacamilleri.wixsite.com/bytesizelearning/post/chapter-50-problem-solving).

# User Stories

 A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer.

## Feature Place an Order

As a customer, when I load the app, I would like to see a menu of food items, so that it is clear what I can order.

| Acceptance Criteria      |
| ------------------------ |
| Display numbered list    | 

As a customer, when I pick a food item, I would like to see the food item added to a cart, so that the total changes.

| Acceptance Criteria                   |
| ------------------------------------- |
| Accept a unique code for food item    |
| Display cart total (number of items) e.g. $15.00 (1) | 

As a customer, when there are food items in my cart, I would like to be able to review it, so that I can either add more items or proceed to payment.
